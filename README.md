Currently connects to the first pair of left and right Joy-Con it can find, and flashes their LEDs in a continuous pattern to verify connection.

The goal is to provide a full-featured userspace driver, configurable from the command line and allowing pairs of Joy-Con to be partnered into one virtual gamepad.
